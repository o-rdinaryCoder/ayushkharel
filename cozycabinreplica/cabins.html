      <h2 class="cabinname">The Ark Cabin</h2>
      <div class="flex2">

          <p>Cozy Cabin Wellness Resort | Lumby, BC</p>
          <p>
            We chose the name "The Ark" for the main house/lodge because every
            cabin is named after an animal and the main house sort of looks like
            an Ark and it suited the name ðŸ™‚ The Ark is more akin to a gorgeous
            lodge that you would see somewhere in a hunting magazine. It's never
            been rented before and it sits on top of the hill when you first
            enter the property. It boasts of over 3500 sq feet with a huge
            kitchen, family place with the coolest fireplace, and a master
            bedroom that lets you gaze at the stars while lying in bed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you decide to rent this in the summer or winter your
            experience will be magical. And since it is significantly larger
            than a cabin you can fit two families. Of course, the kitchens and
            bathrooms are on a whole different level than the cabins. The
            pictures don't do it justice but at least you can get a good idea.
            The Ark has its own wood burning hot tub that isn't shared with any
            other cabins. And it has loft with a sectional sofa that you could
            use as another bed.

            Our Cougar cabin is popular with small retreats, honeymoon couples,
            and guests requesting a larger cabin with more room, both inside and
            out. This cabin boasts a leather sofa, a Lazy-boy soft rocker, a
            large dining table, 3 sleeping areas, a wrap-around deck and a hot
            tub open during the low season months. The hot tub is closed during
            the hotter summer months. The fire pit and picnic area has lots of
            room, with the grassy meadow surrounding it.

            The Lynx cabin is our newest cabin. This cabin is less rustic than
            the other cabins and sits in the back meadow area of the resort. It
            is in a quiet area, is only a short walk to the lake, and you can
            watch your kids play on the play structure from this cabin. It does
            not have a view of the lake, but the grassy meadow stretches wide in
            front of this cabin, making it a great place for family outdoor
            games. It is also the only cabin with a washing machine inside the
            cabin.

            The Elk cabin is one of our most private cabins, siting in a
            location overlooking the large meadow, but less than a minute walk
            to the lake. This cabin is a good choice for families with small
            children, as it is all one level and the shower has a small built in
            seat and tub, making it easier for bathing smaller children.

            far to the left of this cabin. In between these cabins is a
            playhouse and sandbox for the children. This cabin is sometimes used
            for larger families as it has 3 sleeping areas. The complementary
            rowboat is tied to a dock only a few yards from this cabin and the
            rope swing into the lake hangs next to this dock.

            The Beaver cabin sits right above the lake with the Moose cabin not
            far from it on one side and a forest on the other side. It is
            generally considered a quieter area, as it is a little farther from
            the main beach and meadow area, yet still within an easy walk. The
            complementary rowboat is tied to a dock only a few yards from this

            The Deer cabin is our smallest, but one of our most popular cabins
            because of its close proximity to the lake and its log cabin rustic
            charm. It has a large picture window facing East toward the lake and
            the Deer cabinâ€™s veranda is a favourite place to enjoy that first
            morning coffee while watching the sun rise and the baby ducklings
            splashing in the lake. Guests are able to use the large covered fire
            pit that sits next to the cabin and close to the lake and there is a
            complementary rowboat tied to a dock within only a few yards from
            this cabin. This cabin is a pet free cabin.

            The Bear cabin sits close to the Deer cabin and also close to the
            lake and beach area. The kitchen looks out over the large meadow on
            one side of the cabin, while on the other side, towering evergreens
            begin their stretch up the mountain. Parents often like this cabin
            as they can watch their kids from the front porch playing on the
            beach, in the lake or in the meadow. Like the Deer cabin, the climb
            to the loft is more of a ladder climb, so this cabin is best suited
            for children who are comfortable with the steeper climb to the loft.

            camping experience that's unlike anything else than this might fit
            your bill. The walk to the private lake is only 5 min where you can
            fish (catch and release). There's another very good fishing lake
            only a 15 min walk away.
