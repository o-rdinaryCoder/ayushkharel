        <p>
          he Cozy Cabins property has been in use since the mid 1800’s. While
          the original settlers are not known, some of their remnants still
          connect us to their past. The old cabin which is currently known as
          the ‘Chicken Coop’ has housed various forms of livestock for over 100
          years. The barn as well, while being built in the 80’s, uses lumber
          re-purposed from existing outbuildings that dated back over a century.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1958 the property was purchased by 2 hunter/trappers, Jules Lamoth
          and Max Torent. These two were known for their rugged lifestyle, big
          personalities and love of hunting. Jules was once reported missing by
          his logging foreman, the employer stating, “His saw was still in the
          tree, his tools on the ground and it was as if he just vanished.”
          Adding to the mystery was the simultaneous disappearance of a
          neighbouring horse. When the RCMP finally caught up with Jules, he was
          on his way down out of the mountains with a huge elk strapped to the
          back of the horse, explaining “I saw that Elk run by me and I couldn’t
          just let it go. I only needed to borrowed the horse for a few days.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Adding to their mischievous ways was the story of how the original
          Cozy Cabin property was purchased. Having been cheated out of a
          portion of logging wages, Jules and Max went to a prime piece of land
          their employer owned and logged the entire area in secret, as quickly
          as they could. They then sold the timber to a nearby mill and used the
          proceeds to purchase the same land at a price their employer couldn’t
          resist. The original parcel was 160 acres and was purchased for the
          prime price of $800.
        </p>

          Jules and Max spent most of their time logging in camps around BC, but
          would return during break-up to trap in the area. Later there was a
          third man who came to live with the 2 bachelors named Jean-Paul
          Gosling, also an avid logger and trapper.

          With what can only be described as the touch of a very determined
          woman, Hilda began transforming the property into the gem it is today.
          Whereas before she had led a more relaxed life, Hilda was now faced
          with the challenges of living in the Canadian wild with an eccentric
          frenchman. Hilda began to get involved in all aspects of country life
          from logging to chicken raising. With the finances she brought into
          the project she convinced Jules to begin upgrading the ‘shack’ to the
          timber frame house that sits on the property today. The entire house
          was constructed from trees on the property, with some of the beams
          being so long that they had to be freehand cut with a chainsaw rather
          than put through a mill. Much of the work on the house was done by
          Jules and his lifelong friend Jeneu Urcullu. One other man involved in
          the project was a proficient builder named Reynold Mazu. The ‘shack’
          that Jules had lived in for so many years now serves as the living
          room in the completed house. The living room still has the original
          fireplace with baking ovens built into it from its pioneer days.
